# Getting started

We will use AWS infrastructure for our data science platform. AWS Educate is a program that offers students free access to cloud resources. Please read [this overview](AWSEducateOverview.pdf) for a summary of all of the offerings available via [awseducate.com](awseducate.com).

## Accessing credits via AWS Educate
Within AWS Educate there are two primary sources of credits:
* AWS Educate Starter Account
* AWS Educate Classroom Account

### Sign up for the Starter account
Any student may sign up for a starter account. These credits are valid for one year and are not tied to any class. As an AWS Academy institution, Emory students receive additional credits in their starter accounts.
