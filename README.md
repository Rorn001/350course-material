Data Science Computing
====

## Summary of Topics
Along with a primer on linux, scripting, Python and elementary programming concepts, the course introduces foundational knowledge of cloud computing. In the final project, students use Amazon Web Services for data science and machine learning applications.

## Relationship to other courses offered by the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods (QTM)
This course is intended as a follow up to QTM 220, exposing students to popular languages for data analysis that they havenâ€™t used yet, important programming and computing concepts useful when working with computers, and emphasizing good workflows for reproducible research.

## Course objectives
Each student will:
1. Become comfortable working from the command line and using the command line to automate workflow (e.g. write a script for data cleaning a dataset)
2. Learn basic syntax and concepts for popular languages (e.g. Python) and packages (e.g. Numpy, Pandas) used in data science.
3. Learn foundational knowledge of cloud computing
4. Creatively implement what they have been learning in a final project using cloud resources.
